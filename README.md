Struggles
--------
My first experience with Java and a statically typed language has been tough.  I'm not overly happy with my progress
on this one! I found the more complex data structures a lot harder to grasp.  At first, ItelliJ was a challenge to
navigate around but have found that it made the process a lot smoother as all your development tools can be used from
the one place i.e Git,terminal and tests.  I found it tough not being able to experiment with Java in a REPL, that
really slowed the process down for me.  Overall, Java excites me (actually feel like a programmer when coding)and I'm
looking forward to exploring the language more.

Future Improvements
----------
* A LOT!
* More functionality and improve existing functionality
* Get comfortable testing and implementing Mockito
* Potentially turn it into a web app using Spark
